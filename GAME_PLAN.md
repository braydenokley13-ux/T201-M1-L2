# NBA GM Crisis Manager - Game Transformation Plan

## Overview
Transform the Excel-based NBA Luxury Tax simulator into an interactive HTML game where students manage a REAL 2026 NBA team (Milwaukee Bucks) with actual roster, real trade targets, and authentic salary cap situations. Includes animated feedback and gamification elements while maintaining exact same functionality.

## Team Context: 2026 Milwaukee Bucks

### Why the Bucks?
- **Perfect for teaching luxury tax**: Expensive roster, in/near repeater territory
- **Star-driven**: Giannis + Dame create realistic "win-now" pressure
- **Name recognition**: Students know these players and care about outcomes
- **Trade flexibility**: Can realistically target most players in the league
- **Real-world relevance**: Mirrors actual NBA GM decisions in 2026

### Your Team Details
- **Franchise**: Milwaukee Bucks 🦌
- **Core Players**: Giannis Antetokounmpo (29), Damian Lillard (35), Khris Middleton (34)
- **Situation**: Expensive roster, aging core, championship window closing
- **Base Payroll**: Varies by scenario ($260M - $380M)
- **Constraints**: Limited picks, repeater tax concerns, competitive pressure
- **League Context**:
  - Salary Cap: $136M
  - Luxury Tax Line: $165M
  - Repeater penalties apply if marked

### Realism Features
✅ **All trades use real 2026 NBA players** (no generic "All-Star")
✅ **Trade packages make sense** (matching salaries, positional needs)
✅ **Free agents are actually available** (realistic MLE targets)
✅ **Extensions are for your own players** (Giannis, MarJon, etc.)
✅ **Scenarios match real team situations** (injury clouds, repeater years, etc.)
✅ **News headlines reflect actual basketball media** (Journal Sentinel, ESPN style)

## Claim Code Integration
- **Display claim code** for each scenario prominently in the UI
- **Validation system**: Students must enter their claim code when sharing/submitting results
- **Format**: L2-201-M1-[CODE] (e.g., "L2-201-M1-GMN" for Star Injury Cloud)
- **Include in results export**: PDF/shareable results must show the claim code

### Technical Implementation

#### Tax Calculation Logic
```javascript
function calculateLuxuryTax(payroll, taxThreshold = 165, isRepeat = false) {
  const overAmount = payroll - taxThreshold;
  if (overAmount <= 0) return 0;

  // Tax bracket multipliers
  const brackets = [
    { limit: 5, rate: isRepeat ? 1.5 : 1.0 },
    { limit: 10, rate: isRepeat ? 1.75 : 1.25 },
    { limit: 15, rate: isRepeat ? 2.0 : 1.5 },
    { limit: Infinity, rate: isRepeat ? 2.25 : 1.75 }
  ];

  let tax = 0;
  let remaining = overAmount;
  let floor = 0;

  for (const bracket of brackets) {
    const ceiling = bracket.limit === Infinity ? remaining : bracket.limit;
    const taxableInBracket = Math.min(remaining, ceiling - floor);
    tax += taxableInBracket * bracket.rate;
    remaining -= taxableInBracket;
    floor = ceiling;
    if (remaining <= 0) break;
  }

  return tax;
}
```

#### Performance Points Calculation
```javascript
function calculatePerformancePoints(wins, playoffWins, bonuses) {
  const regWinWeight = bonuses.regWinWeight || 1;
  const playoffWinWeight = bonuses.playoffWinWeight || 3;
  const fiftyWinBonus = wins >= 50 ? (bonuses.fiftyWinBonus || 5) : 0;
  const sixtyWinBonus = wins >= 60 ? (bonuses.sixtyWinBonus || 8) : 0;

  return (wins * regWinWeight) +
         (playoffWins * playoffWinWeight) +
         fiftyWinBonus +
         sixtyWinBonus;
}
```

#### Win Projection
```javascript
function projectWins(baseSituation, selectedMoves) {
  let wins = baseSituation.baseWins;
  let playoffWins = baseSituation.basePlayoffWins;
  let payroll = baseSituation.basePayroll;
  let repeatFlag = baseSituation.repeatBase;

  selectedMoves.forEach(move => {
    wins += move.winsDelta;
    playoffWins += move.playoffWinsDelta;
    payroll += move.payrollDelta;
    if (move.repeatFlag === 1) repeatFlag = 1;
  });

  return { wins, playoffWins, payroll, repeatFlag };
}
```
